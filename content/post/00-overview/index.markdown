The figure below is a visual summary of the tentative course schedule. The flow of topics for each week might change slightly depending on how quickly / slowly it feels right to progress through them. You can expect to have between 6-7 lab and 6-8 homework assignments. However the deadlines for assignments will not change barring unexpected circumstances. If deadlines need to be adjusted due to COVID related reasons, they will be pushed to a later date and never pulled up to an earlier date. If it becomes necessary to make such adjustments, I will try my best to avoid collision with other previously scheduled deadlines but this might be difficult to ensure.
