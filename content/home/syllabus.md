## Course Description

Continuing on the themes explored in Data Science 1, students will go beyond data visualization to gain insight from data using statistical and machine learning techniques. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to work with large data sets, transform those data, and apply statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze data. Throughout the course we will be using GitHub, ggplot2, Rmarkdown, and the tidyverse packages for data manipulation, visualization and analysis. This course is intended to appeal to a wide range of students. The skills and habits of mind taught in this course are applicable not only in the sciences and social sciences, but in almost all fields. Evaluation will be based on several short homework and lab assignments, participation in in-class activities, and a final project.


Unit 1 (Week 1 to 2)- Exploring data: This unit is designed as a refresher of data visualization and data wrangling. We end the unit with web scraping and introduce the idea of iteration in preparation for the next unit. Also in this unit students are introduced to the toolkit: R, RStudio, R Markdown, Git, and GitHub.

Unit 2 (Week 3 to 4) - Working with strings, regular expressions, and text analysis. 

Unit 3 (Week 4 to 8) - Making rigorous conclusions: In this unit we introduce modelling and statistical inference for making data-based conclusions. We discuss data ethics alongside building, interpreting, and selecting models, visualizing results, and prediction and model validation.

Unit 4 (Week 9 and 10) - Machine Learning and looking beyond Data Science 2: In this unit we delve into supervised machine learning and finish up the course with project presentations and looking beyond data science II.

## Course Values, Goals, and Practices
 
The computing courses at COA are designed to bridge the liberal arts education to computing and the digital world.  In this, I am committed to actively creating digital and computational spaces that are radically inclusive. This includes integrating equity and social justice throughout the curriculum, and engaging students in metacognition to support this work.


## Learning Objectives

This course is designed as a community learning journey. Together, we will:

- Play with computational ideas creatively, using a growth mindset which values revision and experimentation. 
- Gain experience in data collection, wrangling, visualization, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis and machine learning, as well as effective communication of results while working on problems and case studies inspired by and based on real-world questions.
- Engage and reflect on contemporary issues in environmental and social justice related to your digital world, community and positionality. Critically evaluate the origins of data and the limitations of analysis techniques.
- Demonstrate community leadership skills as a collaborator that shares strengths, builds weaknesses, and contributes to a broader shared understanding. 

It is also my hope that in this course you:

- Develop an appreciation for reproducibility, transparency, accessibility and inclusivity in data collection, analysis, and communication.
- Build knowledge and skills in data science to tackle questions that are important to you. 

## Course Materials required: 

### Books:

All books for this course are freely available online as e-books. We will be using two main texts:
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham
- [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) by Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel and Johanna Hardin.

We will also have chapters and readings from the following opensource books on Text Analysis and Machine Learning:
- [Text Mining with R](https://www.tidytextmining.com/index.html)
- [Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R](https://smltar.com/mlclassification.html)


### Technology:

- Bring a laptop to every class, we will be programming most days! We will be using PositCloud, you will get an invitation to create an account.
- If you are in need of a term long loaner laptop, please contact the IT department at [helpdesk@coa.edu](mailto:helpdesk@coa.edu). Mention that you are taking a data science class, and pick up the laptop in A&S right by the whale skull.

## Course components

### Weekly structure

The class meets on Tuesday and Friday from 13:00-14:25 and on Wednesday from 14:35-16:00. The typical weekly class schedule will be:

| Day| Activity|
| --- | --- |
| Tuesday | Topic Introduction|
| Wednesday | Topic Introduction |
| Friday | Lab |


Outside of class you can expect to spend 
* 1-2 hours on the reading and interactive tutorials per week
* 3-5 hours on homework and labs each week. 

- **Homework:** is assigned on Friday and due the following Friday at 23.59pm EST. Each homework will be introduced on Friday morning and you are encouraged to work on your homework and lab in Friday's workshop class session.
- **Labs:** Labs will be started in class on Friday and are due the following Friday at 23.59pm EST.
- **Reflections:** There will be a number of reflections throughout the course. These will either be open-ended or there will be a prompt to follow. 

### Help sessions

The Teaching Assistant and I will have a handful of help sessions every week. You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun. Things that happen at help sessions:

1. The TAs and/or I am around to offer help on the homework, lab, or project.
2. Some students do most of the assignment while at a help session. They work through problems alone or with others, and find it comforting to know that help is at hand if needed.
3. Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with specific questions.
4. Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about the course.
5. Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the class.

Everyone is welcome at help sessions! Attending these sessions help students do well in class and get as much out of it as possible. 

### Labs

These will be held on Fridays. During these sessions you will work individually or in teams on computing lab exercises and you will finish the exercises after class and turn in your lab reports the following Friday at 23:59 EST. Attendance to class is important as you will be working on your labs individually and together in class. Labs will be submitted as GitHub repositories.

A frequently asked question is "What happens if I can't make it to a lab one week because I'm sick or have another obligation at that time?" Answers below:

- If you're missing a workshop day due to short-term illness or some other reason, you should communicate this with your team and attend a team meeting before the deadline for the assignment to contribute to the teamwork. If you have made 0 commits towards a lab assignment, you will receive no credit for that assignment, so you need to participate both for being a team player and also for your own individual score. 

- If you're unable to contribute to a lab assignment because of an illness taking you away from school work for an extended period of time, you should let me and your team know that you won't be able to contribute to those lab(s) and we can discuss special circumstances and explore alternative arrangements to make up that work. 
  
Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others' time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class once or twice.

### Homework assignments

Beyond the in class activities, you will be assigned weekly larger programming tasks throughout the semester. These assignments will be completed individually, and submitted as GitHub repositories. **Tip:** Do the (optional) R tutorials which will introduce you to the datasets and topics covered in the homework assignments.

### Quizzes

These weekly multiple choice quizzes will help you evaluate your learning continuously. The online quiz will be graded for completion only. You do not need to get any answers right, but it should help you identify what parts of the material you should review. **Tip:** Don't leave it till the last minute!

### Reflections

Throughout the course there will be reflection assignments where we engage and reflect on contemporary issues in environmental and social justice related to our digital world, community and identity. These assignments may be based on an assigned reading or visualizations we encounter in our daily lives.

### Final project

You will be responsible for the completion of an open ended final project for this course, the goal of which is to tackle an "interesting" problem using the tools and techniques covered in this class. Additional details on the project will be provided as the course progresses. Each team's work will also be shared with and evaluated by at least one other team at an earlier stage in order to provide feedback. You must complete the final project and be in class to present it in order to pass this course. **Tip:** Stick to optional interim deadlines (outline, draft presentation) to pace your work on the project.

### Teams 

For all of the team based assignments in this class you will be randomly assigned to teams of 2 or 3 students - these teams will change throughout the trimester. You will work in these teams during class and on the lab assignments. For team based assignments, all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment and you will be asked to evaluate your team members on lyceum after each assignment is due. During the labs, we will be working together using **pair programming**, where you will take it in turns to write and review the the code, swapping roles frequently. Once the assignment is submitted the contributors will share responsibility for any revisions to be made based on feedback. Failure to adequately contribute to an assignment will result in a penalty to your grade relative to the team's overall grade.

Students are expected to make use of the provided GitHub repository as their central collaborative platform. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric (one of several) of each team member's relative contribution for each homework.

## Grades: 

A growing body of research indicates that traditional approaches to grading fail to produce the sorts of meaningful learning desired by both teachers and students. Such approaches often reinforce inequitable power dynamics between teachers and students, promote faulty reward systems that disincentive creativity and risk-taking, and devalue important aspects of learning (including revision and feedback). Given this context, instead of a traditional approach to grading in which you do work that is evaluated singularly by me, this course assumes that you opt to take ownership and responsibility over your performance and engagement with the class. To make this happen, this course uses a "contract grading" scheme, which gives you a voice in the grading process, provides you with the agency to specify your intended course performance, and also share in the responsibility for evaluating whether or not you fulfilled your intended obligations. Please see the contract grading document (on [Google Classroom](https://classroom.google.com/)) for a more-fleshed-out explanation of this approach and how it will operate in the course.

I will also be meeting with each of you individually to set goals at the start of the course.

The work in this course will be comprised of the following components and their weights:

- Homework: 30%
- Lab: 20%
- Project: 20%
- Quizzes: 10%
- Attendance: 10%
- Reflections: 10%

## Policies


### Collaboration policy

Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively. Individual assignments must be completed individually, you may not directly share or discuss answers / code with anyone other than the instructors and tutors. You are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.

### Sharing / reusing code

I am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something the course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class. You are welcome to discuss the problems together and ask for advice, but you may not send or make use of code from another team.

## Academic Integrity (excerpt from Course Catalog)

By enrolling in an academic institution, a student is subscribing to common standards of academic honesty. Any cheating, plagiarism, falsifying or fabricating of data is a breach of such standards. A student must make it their responsibility to not use words or works of others without proper acknowledgement. Plagiarism is unacceptable and evidence of such activity is reported to the provost or their designee. Two violations of academic integrity are grounds for dismissal from the college. Students would request in-class discussions of such questions when complex issues of ethical scholarship arise. 

## Universal Learning and Learning in Community

Many of us learn in different ways.  For example, you may process information by speaking and listening, so while lectures are quite helpful for you, some of the written material may be difficult to absorb. You might have difficulty following lectures, but are able to quickly assimilate written information.  You may need to fidget to focus in class.  You might take notes best when you can draw a concept.  For some of you, speaking in class can be a stressful or daunting experience.  For some of you, certain topics or themes might be so traumatic as to be disruptive to learning. The principle of Universal Design for Learning calls for our classrooms, our virtual spaces, our practices and our interactions to be designed to include as many different modes of learning as possible, and is a principle I take seriously in this class. 

It is also my goal to create an inclusive classroom, which depends on community building, and which requires everyone to come to class with mutual respect, civility, and a willingness to listen to and observe others. As such the syllabus serves as a contract of some expectations between all members of the class, including myself.

If you anticipate or experience any barriers to learning in this course, please reach out to me and your student support advisor. If you have a disability, or think you may have a disability, COA's Disability Support Services located within the Office of Student Life in Deering Commons to develop a plan for your academic accommodations. You can find out more information in the course catalog under *Accommodating students with disabilities*. If you have already been approved for accommodations through the Disability Support Services please let me know! We can meet 1-1 to explore concerns and potential options. 

### Late work, extensions, and special circumstances

All work is due on the stated due date. Due dates are there to help guide your pace through the course and they also allow me to return feedback to you in a timely manner. However, sometimes life gets in the way and you might not be able to turn in your work on time. First, please note that resubmission is built into each assignment. You will receive feedback on each assignment and may resubmit a piece of work incorporating your revisions.

If you intend to submit work late for an assignment or project, you must **notify me** before the original deadline and as soon as the completed work is submitted on GitHub. This allows me to return feedback to you and let's me know when to check your work. Lab work cannot be submitted late. 


### Learning during a pandemic
 
I want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class. If this requires flexibility, please don't hesitate to ask.

- You *never* owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you're always welcome to talk to me. If I can't help, I likely know someone who can.
 
- I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.
