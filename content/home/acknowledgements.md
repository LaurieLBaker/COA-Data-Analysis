I am committed to the promotion and use of open educational resources and software in the journey of designing an accessible computing education. Much of the course description, design, syllabus, website, and educational materials have been adapted from "Data Science in a Box," https://datasciencebox.org/, by Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel under the [Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International](https://github.com/rstudio-education/datascience-box/blob/master/LICENSE.md).

Conceptually, intellectually, and substantively, the course policies and learning objectives draws heavily upon the work of current and past colleagues at College of the Atlantic, Bates College, and beyond including Carrie Diaz Eaton, Anelise H. Shrout, Barry Lawson, Meredith Greer, Ethan Miller, Misty Beck, Francis Eanes, Dave Feldman, as well as scholars beyond these institutions.

This course has also been greatly improved by the feedback of Bates students enrolled in DCS 210 in the Fall and Winter 2021-2022 and students enrolled in Fall ES 1085 2022 at the College of the Atlantic. Special thanks to Bates students Liza Dubinsky and Max Devon worked with me on the design of the accessible data visualization lab.
