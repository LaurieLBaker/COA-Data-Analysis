Most of you will need help at some point and we want to make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help.

- **Google Classroom Forum:** The best way to get any questions on course content, technology, logistics, policies is to post your question on the google classroom forum. And you are encouraged to answer each others' questions here as well. 
- **Help Sessions:** The Teaching Assistant and I will have a handful of help sessions every week. You are warmly invited and encouraged to attend these sessions. Help sessions are relaxed, informal, and hopefully fun. Things that happen at help sessions:

1. The TAs and/or I am around to offer help on the homework, lab, or project.
2. Some students do most of the assignment while at a help session. They work through problems alone or with others, and find it comforting to know that help is at hand if needed.
3. Others do the problems at home and come to the help session with specific questions.
4. Help sessions are also a chance to ask general questions about the course.
5. Help sessions are a great way to meet other students in the class.

Everyone is welcome at help sessions! Attending these sessions help students do well in class and get as much out of it as possible. 

- **Email:** Please refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go on Google Classroom), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g. illness, missed assignments).
- For more general support and advice, please make use of the resources on Campus which you will find in the College course catalog. If you're not sure where to go for help, just ask.
