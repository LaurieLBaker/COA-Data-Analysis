Most of you will need help at some point and we want to make sure you can identify when that is without getting too frustrated and feel comfortable seeking help.

- **Google Classroom Forum:** The best way to get any questions on course content, technology, logistics, policies is to post your question on the google classroom forum. And you are encouraged to answer each others' questions here as well. When you post a question on google classroom, you can choose to do so anonymously to your classmates. Note that the course instructor and tutors can always see your name, and this is for a good reason! We want to be able to identify students who might be struggling so that we can extend help. Similarly, we want to know who you are if you're providing great answers to others' questions! 
- **Help Sessions:** Help sessions are times for you to ask me questions about the course such as discussing a homework, asking me to explain a concept, or discuss future plans like majors, careers, and internships. The TAs and I will be hosting several weekly help sessions throughout the course. Help sessions will be held on Wednesday from 2:30-3:30 and Thursday from 1:30-2:30. You can book to either meet me in my office or to go for a walk through [calendly](https://calendly.com/lauriebaker-coa). At busy points throughout the semester I will open up additional time slots and if you don't see a time slot that works for you send me an email. Please feel free to drop by with any questions, or just to say hi! 
- **Email:** Please refrain from emailing any course content questions (those should go on Google Classroom), and only use email for questions about personal matters that may not be appropriate for the public course forum (e.g. illness, missed assignments).
- For more general support and advice, please make use of the resources on Campus which you will find in the College course catalog. If you're not sure where to go for help, just ask.
