Hi everyone! I'm Sengdao. I am a TA for Data Science II: Data Analysis. I am passionate about using data to drive insights and make informed decisions, and I am excited to guide you through this course's data visualization portion. Come and chat with me about data, programming, web development, and the latest technology trends.  I will hold weekly help sessions that you can find under the timetable. But I can be very flexible with my help session hours, so we can arrange to meet at your convenient time. 

I look forward to working with you all!
