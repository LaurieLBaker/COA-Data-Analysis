This course builds on Data Science 1 where students developed skills in data collection, data cleaning, and creating different types of data visualizations (e.g. bar charts, scatter plots, density plots, heat maps, violin plots, time series, and interactive graphics) and effective data communication while working on problems and case studies inspired by and based on real-world questions. Continuing on the themes explored in Data Science 1, students will go beyond data visualization to gain insight from data using statistical and machine learning techniques. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to work with large data sets, transform those data, and apply statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze data. Students will build on their knowledge of GitHub, ggplot2, Rmarkdown, and the tidyverse packages for data manipulation, visualization and analysis, to include an analytical toolkit for answering different types of questions and working with different types of data. Students will be exposed to a variety of topics including: webscraping, generalized linear models and machine learning. Each year we will also explore several advanced special topics in data science which may include topics such as text analysis, image processing, and spatial analysis.
